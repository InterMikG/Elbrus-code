# About-Elbrus-code
Hello, user. This is my first file. I'm not sure if it can work, but I've tried. If you have a question: "What is Elbrus?", I'll explain it to you now.

Elbrus-4C is a microprocessor architecture developed by MCST (Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies) in Russia. 
It is designed to be compatible with the SPARC (Scalable Processor Architecture) instruction set and targets high-performance computing and server applications.
You can found about it more in the Wikipedia or other sources.
